# Employee-Tracker

My Goal for this project this week was to create an application that featured an employee database using node.js inquirer, and MySQL. 
During this project I learned how to create tables using sql and javascript. I also learned how to add sql syntax to adjust and add changes to my tables. I am still not proficient on how to use node.js inquirer and MySQL but with the help of tutoring and asking questions I am learning alot. I also implemented query select withing my JS.
